# Expense-Tracker

This is an application to add and track expenses using React. Inspired from the course "React - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## Backend API

An Express server backed by MongoDB provides CRUD endpoints under `/api/expenses`.
Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and adjust the `MONGO_URI` if needed.

## Running the application

Use `npm start` in the repo root to run both the client and the server during development.
